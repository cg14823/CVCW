# CVCW
Object Detection Challenge

Basic Task Structure:
 The task runs over approximately 5 weeks. It 
consists of four subtasks which incrementally build upon each other:  
- First
 (up to max 10% of CW mark)
, there is an introductory part 
which helps you to understand how the Viola-Jones detector can be 
used in OpenCV and lets you experience how it operates in practice. 
In particular, you will experiment with an off-the-shelf face detector. 
- Secondly
 (up to max 20% of CW mark)
, you will build your own 
object  detector  by  training  the  Viola-Jones  framework  on  a 
customized object class, that is `dartboards’. You will then test the 
detector’s performance and interpret your results on an image set. 
- 
Thirdly
 (up to max 40% of CW mark)
, you will combine your 
detector with a Hough transform for component configurations of 
the  dartboard  shape  in  order  to  improve  detections.  A  Hough 
transform (e.g. for concentric lines, circles, ellipses) should be used, 
combined and evaluated together with the Viola Jones detector. 
- 
Fourthly
 (up to max 10% of CW mark)
, in order to be able to reach 
marks  above  the  first  class  boundary,  we  ask you  to  research, 
understand  and  use  in  OpenCV  one  other  appropriate  vision 
approach  to  further  improve  the  detection  efficacy  and/or 
efficiency. 
-
Thefinal 20% of the CW mark
 is reserved for excellence throughout 
your work, how well you inform your development on evidence and 
evaluation. Here we look for an outstanding understanding, concise 
presentation and clean implementation. Top marks in this category 
are reserved for work that is novel and publishable in principle
